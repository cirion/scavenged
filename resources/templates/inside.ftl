Cowabunga, dude! I’m so glad you could make it to my party!
</p>
<p>
I’ve missed seeing everyone in person, and I’ve grown really fond of catching up with people on video.
I’ll be hanging out in a <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89152901593">Zoom room</a>
until around 3pm PDT / 6pm EDT. If you’d like to hop in for a minute to say “Hey” or an hour to catch up,
I’d love to see you!
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure if that room will get crowded. If it does, and you’d like to hang out with any other guests at the
party, feel free to start separate video calls in the discord server or your platform of choice.
</p>
<p>
I know lots of you are feeling Zoom’d out, so no worries at all if you’d like to call it a day!
We can reconnect some other time.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again for joining me in celebrating the fortieth anniversary of my birth. It means a lot to me that
you’d spend a chunk of your precious Sunday playing some goofy games and solving inane puzzles with me.
I hope that you are staying safe, staying healthy and staying sane!
</p>
<p>
When the <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89152901593">Zoom room</a> prompts for a password, enter the last
word in the second paragraph of my letter in your box. See you soon!
